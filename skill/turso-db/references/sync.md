# Sync (Remote Replication)

Turso supports bidirectional sync between a local embedded database and a remote Turso Cloud instance. This enables offline-first applications where reads are always fast (local) and writes sync when connectivity is available.

## CRITICAL: Always Use the Sync SDK

**A synced database file MUST only be opened through the sync SDK** (e.g., `turso::sync::Builder` in Rust, `turso.sync.connect()` in Python, `tursogo.NewTursoSyncDb()` in Go, etc.).

**NEVER open a synced database with:**
- The `tursodb` CLI
- A non-sync SDK (e.g., plain `turso::Builder` / `turso.connect()`)
- SQLite directly (`sqlite3`, `better-sqlite3`, etc.)
- Any other tool that can open SQLite/WAL files

**Why:** The sync engine relies on specific WAL invariants (frame positions, revision tracking, CDC state) to function correctly. Any external access can trigger a checkpoint or modify the WAL in ways that break these invariants, **corrupting the sync state permanently**. The database may appear fine locally but will fail to push/pull, or worse, silently lose data on the next sync.

If you need to inspect a synced database, make a copy of the file first and open the copy.

## Core Operations

Every SDK exposes these sync operations:

### `pull()`

Downloads remote changes to the local replica.

1. Sends current local revision to remote
2. Remote responds with all frames since that revision
3. Frames are applied to local WAL
4. Local metadata updated with new revision

After pull, local queries immediately see remote changes.

### `push()`

Uploads local changes to the remote.

1. Collects logical changes from local CDC table (since last push)
2. Sends changes as batched SQL to remote
3. Remote applies changes atomically
4. Local metadata updated

### `checkpoint()`

Compacts the local WAL by transferring synced frames back to the main database file, then truncating the WAL. Also maintains a revert database that preserves pre-sync page state, enabling the sync engine to roll back local changes when pulling remote updates.

### `stats()`

Returns current sync engine statistics:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cdc_operations` | Number of pending CDC operations (since last push) |
| `main_wal_size` | Current main WAL file size in bytes |
| `revert_wal_size` | Current revert WAL file size in bytes |
| `network_sent_bytes` | Total bytes uploaded to remote |
| `network_received_bytes` | Total bytes downloaded from remote |
| `last_pull_unix_time` | Unix timestamp of last pull (null if never pulled) |
| `last_push_unix_time` | Unix timestamp of last push (null if never pushed) |
| `revision` | Current synced revision (opaque token, null if not yet synced) |

## Bootstrap

On first sync with an empty local database, a **bootstrap** downloads the full remote database:

- **Full bootstrap** (default): Downloads all pages — the local replica becomes a complete copy
- **Partial bootstrap** (experimental): Downloads only a subset of data, reducing initial bandwidth. Remaining pages are fetched on demand.

Set `bootstrapIfEmpty: false` to skip the automatic bootstrap on first pull. The database will be created locally but remain empty until you explicitly pull. This is useful when you want the database ready for sync but want to delay the initial download (e.g., waiting for user login or network conditions).

### Partial Sync Configuration

Partial sync is experimental and available in JavaScript, WASM, React Native, Python, and Go SDKs. Configuration options:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `bootstrapStrategy` | How to select initial data: `prefix` (load first N bytes) or `query` (load pages touched by a SQL statement) |
| `segmentSize` | Load pages in batches of this many bytes. E.g., with `segmentSize=131072` (128KB), accessing page 1 loads pages 1–32 together |
| `prefetch` | When `true`, the sync engine proactively fetches pages that are likely to be accessed soon based on access patterns |

## SDK Availability

| SDK | Sync Support | Sync Package/Feature |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|
| Rust | Yes | `turso` crate with `sync` feature |
| Python | Yes | `turso.sync` / `turso.aio.sync` modules |
| Go | Yes | `tursogo.NewTursoSyncDb()` |
| WASM | Yes | `@tursodatabase/sync-wasm` (separate package) |
| React Native | Yes | Built into `@tursodatabase/sync-react-native` |
| JavaScript (Node.js) | Yes | `@tursodatabase/sync` (separate package) |

## Important Notes

- **NEVER open a synced database outside the sync SDK** — CLI, SQLite, or non-sync SDKs will corrupt sync state
- Sync is **explicit** — call push/pull manually; there is no automatic background sync
- Local reads never block on network — they always read from the local replica
- Pull is idempotent — safe to call multiple times
- Both push and pull are atomic — partial failures don't corrupt the database
- Remote encryption is supported via cipher + key configuration (see SDK-specific docs)
